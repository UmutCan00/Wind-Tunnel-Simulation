# Wind-Tunnel-Simulation
This is a Wind Tunnel Simulation made in Unreal Engine 5 for a hackathon organized by Infinia Engineering on 17 June 2023. It was made in less than 24 hours and will not recieve any updates after the initial commit. To run the simulation you have to install Unreal Engine 5 and open the WindTunnel.uproject. You can drag objects into the WindTunnel by holding e, if you open the project in developer mode you can add more wind sources and objects. Also you can edit data like temperature, velocity of particles, diffusion rate, etc. and see their effect on the wind tunnel.
